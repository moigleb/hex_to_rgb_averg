Write a function that takes 2 colors as arguments and returns the average color.

- The parameters will be two 6-digit hexadecimal strings. This does not need to be validated.
- The return value should be a 6-digit hexadecimal string.

- The hexadecimal strings represent colors in RGB, much like in CSS.

- The average color is to be determined by taking the arithmetic mean for each component: red, green and blue.
